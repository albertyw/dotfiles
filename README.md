Dot Files
=========

I've created this repo (based off of @hrs's dotfiles repo) 
in order to keep my home directory dot files and other useful 
files in one place so that when I get an account on a new 
computer, I can just git clone this repo and run link.sh

Setup
-----
Git clone this repo  
git clone git@github.com:albertyw/dotfiles.git

Run link.sh to create symlinks

Props to Harry Schwartz (@hrs)
