This isn't enabled by default, and\nyou can edit the colour and type of line.\n\n![screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/lIYBxQX.png)\n\n\nWhen selecting more than one line of text, you can enable selection borders at\nthe top and bottom of the selections. This isn't enabled by default.\nCourtesy of [@djak250](https://github.com/djak250)\n\n![screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/G1b8eAJ.png)\n\nYou can now toggle the highlighted line by:  ```cmd+alt+H```\nYou can now toggle the hiding the highlight on selecting text by:  ```cmd+shift+alt+H```\n\nYou can now toggle the underline by:  ```cmd+alt+U```\nYou can now toggle the selection borders by:  ```cmd+shift+alt+U```\n\nI've moved this package to use the new decorations API and as such we can no\nlonger set arbitrary style on the lines. So, this means no more entering colours/\nopacity in the settings.\n\n# Customisation\n\nYou can update the colours by either updating the ```line-colors.less``` file\nonce you've installed the package. Or by adding the following to your ```syle.less```\n\nI don't use the ```.cursor-line``` class as when you make selection on the\nsame line, you then lose the highlight.\n\n```scss\natom-text-editor::shadow {\n  // The cursor line important to use rgba for opacity, also requires !important\n  // to override any theme.\n  .line.highlight-line {\n    background: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3) !important;\n  }\n\n  // Replace 'solid', with 'dashed' or 'dotted' depending of what you have\n  // set in the settings page.\n\n  // This is for the bottom line (underline)\n  .line.highlight-line-multi-line-solid-bottom {\n    border-bottom-color: red;\n  }\n\n  // This is for the top line when you have the selection borders enabled.\n  .line.highlight-line-multi-line-solid-top {\n    border-top-color: red;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo remove unused settings delete them from your ```config.cson```.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"highlight-line@0.10.1","_shasum":"5b89bdd97b2562d4240b3452f1ba00ccd2e7cc3d","_resolved":"file:../d-115219-9977-u78nka/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115219-9977-u78nka/package.tgz"}
